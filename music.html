You and me we made a vow
<BR>
For better or for worse
<BR>
I can't believe you let me down
<BR>
But the proof is in the way it hurts
<BR>
For months on end I've had my doubts
<BR>
Denying every tear
<BR>
I wish this would be over now
<BR>
But I know that I still need you here
<BR>
<BR>
You say I'm crazy
<BR>
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
<BR>
But when you call me baby
<BR>
I know I'm not the only one
<BR>
<BR>
