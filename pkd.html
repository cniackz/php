		<h1>Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet</h1>

		<p>
			The paleolithic ketogenic diet keeps the body in constant ketosis.<BR>
			It uses free fatty acids and ketone bodies like beta-hydroxybutyrate,<BR>
			produced by the liver from the free fatty acids for a balanced supply<BR>
			of energy which is more efficient than carbohydrates.
