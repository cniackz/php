<h1>Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet</h1>
<p>
The paleolithic ketogenic diet keeps<BR>
the body in constant ketosis. It uses<BR>
free fatty acids and ketone bodies like<BR>
beta-hydroxybutyrate, produced by the<BR>
liver from the free fatty acids for a<BR>
balanced supply of energy which is more<BR>
efficient than carbohydrates. One gram<BR>
of fat produces nine kilocalories,<BR>
while one gram of carbohydrates<BR>
produces only four kilocalories.<BR>
<BR>
It must be noticed right in the<BR>
beginning that ketosis is not<BR>
equivalent to ketoacidosis and neither<BR>
does it predispose to ketoacidosis.<BR>
Contrary to popular belief, the brain<BR>
is able to use ketones to cover its<BR>
energy demand. The ketogenic mode is<BR>
markedly better for the brain than<BR>
carbohydrate-based functioning. Use of<BR>
ketones bodies occurs in organells<BR>
called mitochondria. Among the cells in<BR>
our body it is only red blood cells<BR>
that cannot use ketones for energy<BR>
because they do not have mitochondria.<BR>
All other cells can use ketones for<BR>
energy. Our physiological functions<BR>
can be maintained if our diet<BR>
consist only of fat and protein, since<BR>
these generate enough glucose for our<BR>
body (via a process called<BR>
gluconeogenesis).<BR>
<BR>
Several well documented cases have<BR>
shown that animal meat-fat diets, such<BR>
as that of the Artic Inuit people and<BR>
the anthropologist studying them, can<BR>
be sustainable in the long-term. It<BR>
should also be considered that while we<BR>
are familiar with the symptoms of<BR>
protein deficiency (starving people in<BR>
Africa) as well as the medical problems<BR>
associated with a low fat intake, the<BR>
medical community is unaware of the<BR>
medical conditions caused by a low<BR>
carbohydrate intake (Westman, 2002).<BR>
<BR>
Experiments have been performed where<BR>
rats and chickens have remained healthy<BR>
in the long run, as long as a<BR>
sufficient amount of protein and fat<BR>
was consumed (Renner and Elcombe,<BR>
1967). This indicates that neither<BR>
theoricallly, nor practically, do we<BR>
have a need for carbohydrates in our<BR>
diets. We need not to be affraid that<BR>
not eating carbohydrates causes low<BR>
blood sugar. This is impossible because<BR>
of glycogenesis, a process that<BR>
produces glucose from protein. In order<BR>
to achieve ketosis, the fat to protein<BR>
ratio should be at least 2:1 (in grams<BR>
of macronutrients). Eating too much<BR>
protein can inhibit the development of<BR>
ketosis. Thus, the emphasis of the<BR>
Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet is not on<BR>
animal protein, but on the consumption<BR>
of animal fats. To stay in ketosis,<BR>
carbohydrates consumption should not<BR>
exceed 20-30 grams per day. This amount<BR>
will vary from individual to<BR>
individual, because it depends on the<BR>
actual energy consumption as well as<BR>
the weight of the individual. Of<BR>
course, only those foodstuffs that meet<BR>
the quality requirements of the<BR>
Paleolithic diet can be part of the<BR>
Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet.<BR>
<BR>
Within the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet,<BR>
the proper ratio of food items is able<BR>
to ensure intake of essential fatty<BR>
acids, essential amino acids, vitamins,<BR>
minerals and trace elements in both the<BR>
short and long term. While following<BR>
the diet, there is no need to take<BR>
supplements. The frequency of eating<BR>
should be dictated by when you feel<BR>
hungry. This also applies to fluid<BR>
consumption, regardless of age. Tap<BR>
water, carbon-filtered water or spring<BR>
water are recommended to drink.<BR>
<BR>
In our opinion, the Paleolithic<BR>
Ketogenic Diet is the healthy diet, and<BR>
so, if an ill person stops following<BR>
the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet, then<BR>
their condition is boound to worsen.<BR>
Their condition would also worsen if<BR>
the patient stayed within the limits of<BR>
the conventional Paleolithic diet or<BR>
the carnivore diet. The Paleolithic<BR>
Ketogenic Diet is sustainable for any<BR>
length of time. When followed<BR>
correctly, there are no side effects,<BR>
and it is safe for children, adults<BR>
and seniors. It is easy to learn and<BR>
simple to maintain. However, it goes<BR>
against the advice of almost all other<BR>
official dietary recommendations. We<BR>
use the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet in<BR>
the practice of medical rehabilitation<BR>
for both moderate and severe disorders.<BR>
<BR>
The enforcement of such a diet may<BR>
require a radical overhaul of the drugs<BR>
taken by the patient. Chemotherapy,<BR>
immunosuppressive therapy and steroid<BR>
treatments require a complex and<BR>
comprenhensive approach when starting<BR>
the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet.<BR>
Therefore, if you are under treatment<BR>
for any disease but would like to start<BR>
the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet, talk to<BR>
an experienced healthcare profressional<BR>
also knowledgable about the Paleolithic<BR>
Ketogenic Diet and start the diet under<BR>
supervision.<BR>

<h2>History of the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet</h2>
<p>
The history of the Paleolithic<BR>
Ketogenic Diet has roots in both the<BR>
classical ketogenic and the Paleolithic<BR>
diets, hence the name. The history of<BR>
the ketogenic diet over the last<BR>
hundred years has been closely<BR>
interwined with the history of epilepsy<BR>
treatment. In 1921, at the Mayo Clinic,<BR>
Russell Wilder was the first to use the<BR>
ketogenic diet to treat people with<BR>
epilepsy. In the 1920s and 1930s, use<BR>
of the ketogenic diet spread, and at<BR>
that time it was essentially the only<BR>
treatment method used for epilepsy<BR>
patients in the United States. The<BR>
first drug for epilepsy (phenytoin) was<BR>
introduced in 1937 and with its<BR>
 release, the ketogenic diet as a<BR>
treatment option was relegated to the<BR>
background. The ketogenic diet's<BR>
rediscovery can be attributed to a<BR>
Hollywood producer. In the early 1990s,<BR>
Jim Abrahams was searching for a<BR>
treatment for epilepsy because medicine<BR>
could not control his son's epileptic<BR>
seizures. Abraham found the answer in<BR>
the method used decades before. His son<BR>
became seizure-free, and Abrahams<BR>
believed that the method could help<BR>
other patients too. He filmed a<BR>
documentary, created a foundation and<BR>
wrote articles, all of which went on to<BR>
popularize the ketogenic diet. His work<BR>
launched the second wave of the<BR>
ketogenic diet, which doctors<BR>
specialized in epilepsy later embraced.<BR>

Currently, the Baltimore-based Johns<BR>
Hopkins hospital is considered to be<BR>
the center of the movement. From 2000<BR>
on, there have been attempts to find a<BR>
balance between the efficiency and<BR>
feasibility of newer versions of the<BR>
ketogenic diet, such as the modified<BR>
Atkins diet and the low glycemic index<BR>
diets. The ketogenic diet has been used<BR>
to treat neurological diseases other<BR>
than epilepsy, such as Type 1 and Type<BR>
2 diabetes, obesity, and liver desease<BR>
(PÃ©rez-Guisado, 2007).<BR>
