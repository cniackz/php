		<h1>Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet</h1>

		<p>
The paleolithic ketogenic diet keeps<BR>
the body in constant ketosis. It uses<BR>
free fatty acids and ketone bodies like<BR>
beta-hydroxybutyrate, produced by the<BR>
liver from the free fatty acids for a<BR>
balanced supply of energy which is more<BR>
efficient than carbohydrates. One gram<BR>
of fat produces nine kilocalories,<BR>
while one gram of carbohydrates<BR>
produces only four kilocalories.<BR>
<BR>
It must be noticed right in the beginning that ketosis<BR>
is not equivalent to ketoacidosis and neither does it<BR>
predispose to ketoacidosis. Contrary to popular belief,<BR>
the brain is able to use ketones to cover its energy<BR>
demand. The ketogenic mode is markedly better for the<BR>
brain than carbohydrate-based functioning. Use of ketones<BR>
bodies occurs in organells called mitochondria. Among the<BR>
cells in our body it is only red blood cells that cannot<BR>
use ketones for energy because they do not have<BR>
mitochondria. All other cells can use ketones for energy.<BR>
