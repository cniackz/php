		<h1>Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet</h1>

		<p>
The paleolithic ketogenic diet keeps the body in constant<BR>
ketosis. It uses free fatty acids and ketone bodies like<BR>
beta-hydroxybutyrate, produced by the liver from the free<BR>
fatty acids for a balanced supply of energy which is more<BR>
efficient than carbohydrates. One gram of fat produces nine<BR>
kilocalories, while one gram of carbohydrates produces only<BR>
four kilocalories.<BR>
<BR>
It must be noticed right in the beginning that ketosis<BR>
is not equivalent to ketoacidosis and neither does it<BR>
predispose to ketoacidosis. Contrary to popular belief,<BR>
the brain is able to use ketones to cover its energy<BR>
demand. The ketogenic mode is markedly better for the<BR>
brain than carbohydrate-based functioning. Use of ketones<BR>
bodies occurs in organells called mitochondria.<BR>
