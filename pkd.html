		<h1>Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet</h1>

		<p>
The paleolithic ketogenic diet keeps<BR>
the body in constant ketosis. It uses<BR>
free fatty acids and ketone bodies like<BR>
beta-hydroxybutyrate, produced by the<BR>
liver from the free fatty acids for a<BR>
balanced supply of energy which is more<BR>
efficient than carbohydrates. One gram<BR>
of fat produces nine kilocalories,<BR>
while one gram of carbohydrates<BR>
produces only four kilocalories.<BR>
<BR>
It must be noticed right in the<BR>
beginning that ketosis is not<BR>
equivalent to ketoacidosis and neither<BR>
does it predispose to ketoacidosis.<BR>
Contrary to popular belief, the brain<BR>
is able to use ketones to cover its<BR>
energy demand. The ketogenic mode is<BR>
markedly better for the brain than<BR>
carbohydrate-based functioning. Use of<BR>
ketones bodies occurs in organells<BR>
called mitochondria. Among the cells in<BR>
our body it is only red blood cells<BR>
that cannot use ketones for energy<BR>
because they do not have mitochondria.<BR>
All other cells can use ketones for<BR>
energy. Our physiological functions<BR>
can be maintained if our diet<BR>
consist only of fat and protein, since<BR>
these generate enough glucose for our<BR>
body (via a process called<BR>
gluconeogenesis).<BR>
<BR>
Several well documented cases have<BR>
shown that animal meat-fat diets, such<BR>
as that of the Artic Inuit people and<BR>
the anthropologist studying them, can<BR>
be sustainable in the long-term. It<BR>
should also be considered that while we<BR>
are familiar with the symptoms of<BR>
protein deficiency (starving people in<BR>
Africa) as well as the medical problems<BR>
associated with a low fat intake, the<BR>
medical community is unaware of the<BR>
medical conditions caused by a low<BR>
carbohydrate intake (Westman, 2002).<BR>
