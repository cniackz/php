<h1>Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet</h1>
<p>
The paleolithic ketogenic diet keeps<BR>
the body in constant ketosis. It uses<BR>
free fatty acids and ketone bodies like<BR>
beta-hydroxybutyrate, produced by the<BR>
liver from the free fatty acids for a<BR>
balanced supply of energy which is more<BR>
efficient than carbohydrates. One gram<BR>
of fat produces nine kilocalories,<BR>
while one gram of carbohydrates<BR>
produces only four kilocalories.<BR>
<BR>
It must be noticed right in the<BR>
beginning that ketosis is not<BR>
equivalent to ketoacidosis and neither<BR>
does it predispose to ketoacidosis.<BR>
Contrary to popular belief, the brain<BR>
is able to use ketones to cover its<BR>
energy demand. The ketogenic mode is<BR>
markedly better for the brain than<BR>
carbohydrate-based functioning. Use of<BR>
ketones bodies occurs in organells<BR>
called mitochondria. Among the cells in<BR>
our body it is only red blood cells<BR>
that cannot use ketones for energy<BR>
because they do not have mitochondria.<BR>
All other cells can use ketones for<BR>
energy. Our physiological functions<BR>
can be maintained if our diet<BR>
consist only of fat and protein, since<BR>
these generate enough glucose for our<BR>
body (via a process called<BR>
gluconeogenesis).<BR>
<BR>
Several well documented cases have<BR>
shown that animal meat-fat diets, such<BR>
as that of the Artic Inuit people and<BR>
the anthropologist studying them, can<BR>
be sustainable in the long-term. It<BR>
should also be considered that while we<BR>
are familiar with the symptoms of<BR>
protein deficiency (starving people in<BR>
Africa) as well as the medical problems<BR>
associated with a low fat intake, the<BR>
medical community is unaware of the<BR>
medical conditions caused by a low<BR>
carbohydrate intake (Westman, 2002).<BR>
<BR>
Experiments have been performed where<BR>
rats and chickens have remained healthy<BR>
in the long run, as long as a<BR>
sufficient amount of protein and fat<BR>
was consumed (Renner and Elcombe,<BR>
1967). This indicates that neither<BR>
theoricallly, nor practically, do we<BR>
have a need for carbohydrates in our<BR>
diets. We need not to be affraid that<BR>
not eating carbohydrates causes low<BR>
blood sugar. This is impossible because<BR>
of glycogenesis, a process that<BR>
produces glucose from protein. In order<BR>
to achieve ketosis, the fat to protein<BR>
ratio should be at least 2:1 (in grams<BR>
of macronutrients). Eating too much<BR>
protein can inhibit the development of<BR>
ketosis. Thus, the emphasis of the<BR>
Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet is not on<BR>
animal protein, but on the consumption<BR>
of animal fats. To stay in ketosis,<BR>
carbohydrates consumption should not<BR>
exceed 20-30 grams per day. This amount<BR>
will vary from individual to<BR>
individual, because it depends on the<BR>
actual energy consumption as well as<BR>
the weight of the individual. Of<BR>
course, only those foodstuffs that meet<BR>
the quality requirements of the<BR>
Paleolithic diet can be part of the<BR>
Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet.<BR>
<BR>
Within the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet,<BR>
the proper ratio of food items is able<BR>
to ensure intake of essential fatty<BR>
acids, essential amino acids, vitamins,<BR>
minerals and trace elements in both the<BR>
short and long term. While following<BR>
the diet, there is no need to take<BR>
supplements. The frequency of eating<BR>
should be dictated by when you feel<BR>
hungry. This also applies to fluid<BR>
consumption, regardless of age. Tap<BR>
water, carbon-filtered water or spring<BR>
water are recommended to drink.<BR>
